# How we define "Memory"

The term “Memory” has recently been used in a broader sense than the narrower usage popularized by Langchain and earlier
LLM agent work, which referred to the “chat history” between an agent and a human.

In the comparison below we compare
the pros and cons of using a number of popular infrastructure technologies for storing and retrieving Memory in the
“chat history” sense.
