# Key Concepts


### Collections

A collection is a set of documents that share a common embedding strategy and embedding model. **Zep automatically creates embeddings** from the documents you provide it, or **you can provide the embeddings** when you add your documents to a collection. All documents in a collection must have been embedded using the same model.

### Documents

Documents are the texts that you want to embed and search over. Documents are added to collections. Documents may have a unique ID and metadata associated with them. **If metadata is added, you can use it to filter search results.**
